## Ideas

### Baseline Models

- XGBoost predicting gini from node attributes
- GNN predicting gini without edge-attributes



### Missing Data

- To *interpolate* missing data one network must somehow have information of the other networks.
    - cross-attention?
    - one huge network with all kinds of links





## Questions

- If we separate the networks, how can the different networks be reallly combined.
    - eg. in case of missing data
    - If we completely separate the networks we lose potential information
- Countries with missing data in GINI will most likely also have missing data in other data sources
